Abstract
To any Frobenius superalgebra A we associate an oriented Frobenius Brauer cate-
gory and an affine oriented Frobenius Brauer categeory. We define natural actions
of these categories on categories of supermodules for general linear Lie superalgebras
glm n(A) with entries in A. These actions generalize those on module categories for
general linear Lie superalgebras and queer Lie superalgebras, which correspond to
the cases where A is the ground field and the two-dimensional Clifford superalgebra,
respectively. We include background on monoidal supercategories and Frobenius
superalgebras and discuss some possible further directions.

Introduction
This thesis is an expanded treatment of the material appearing in [18]. We have
included additional details and background information for the less advanced reader.
The oriented Brauer category OB is the free linear rigid symmetric monoidal
category generated by a single object ". This universal property immediately implies
the existence of a monoidal functor
F : OB ! mod-gln
from OB to the category of right modules for the general linear Lie algebra gln. (One
can also work with left modules, but right modules turn out to be easier for this
thesis.) This functor sends the generating object " and its dual # to the defining
gln-module V and its dual V x, respectively. For r x 1, the endomorphism algebra
EndOB("
r) is the group algebra of the symmetric group on r letters, and the algebra
homomorphism
EndOB("
r) ! Endgln(V 
r)
induced by F is the classical one appearing in Schur-Weyl duality. More generally,
EndOB("
r 
 #
s) are walled Brauer algebras and the induced algebra homomorphisms
EndOB("
r 
 #
s) ! Endgln(V 
r 
 (V x)
s)
were originally defined and studied by Turaev [30] and Koike [16].
The rank n of gln appears as a parameter in OB. In fact, the definition of OB
makes sense for any value of this parameter, i.e. it need not be a positive integer. This
observation leads to the definition of Deligne's interpolating category for the general
linear Lie groups [9]; this interpolating category is the additive Karoubi envelope of
OB.
The functor F yields an action of OB on mod-gln. More precisely, for a category
C, let End (C) denote the corresponding strict monoidal category of endofunctors and
natural transformations. Then we have a functor
OB ! End (mod-gln);
1
1. INTRODUCTION 2
X 7! F(X) 
 􀀀;
f 7! F(f) 
 􀀀;
for objects X and morphisms f in OB. In [4], this was extended to an action of
the affine oriented Brauer category AOB on mod-gln. The category AOB is obtained
from OB by adjoining an additional endomorphism of the generating object ", subject
to certain natural relations. This additional endomorphism acts by a natural transformation
of the functor V 
 􀀀 arising from multiplication by a certain canonical
element of gln 
 gln. Restricting to endomorphism spaces recovers actions of affine
walled Brauer algebras studied in [22, 23].
In fact, much of the above picture can be generalized, replacing gln by the general
linear Lie superalgebra glm n. Remarkably, one does not need to modify OB or AOB
at all. Here the corresponding Schur{Weyl duality was established by Sergeev [27]
and Berele{Regev [1], while the action of the walled Brauer algebras was described in
[8, Th. 7.8]. The analogue of the functor F above is described in [10, Th. 4.16]. The
extension of the action to AOB does not seem to have appeared in the literature, but
is certainly expected by experts. For example, it is mentioned in the introduction to
[4].
The affine oriented Brauer category AOB is a special case of more general category.
The Heisenberg category at central charge 􀀀1 was first introduced by Khovanov
[15] as a tool to study the representation theory of the symmetric group. In [17], it
was generalized to arbitrary negative central charge, which corresponds to replacing
the symmetric group by more general degenerate cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type
A. In [2], Brundan gave a simplified presentation of the Heisenberg category Heisk
at arbitrary central charge k. When k = 0, the Heisenberg category is precisely the
affine oriented Brauer category.
The Heisenberg category has been further generalized in [21, 24, 7] to the Frobe-
nius Heisenberg category Heisk(A) depending on a Frobenius superalgebra A. When
A = |, this construction recovers the Heisenberg category. When k 6= 0, the category
Heisk(A) acts naturally on categories of modules over the cyclotomic wreath product
algebras defined in [25]. However, actions in the case k = 0 have not yet been studied.
In some sense, central charge zero yields the simplest and most interesting case. For
example, Heisk(A) is symmetric monoidal if and only if k = 0.
1.1 Original Contributions of the Thesis
In analogy with the A = | case, we call the Frobenius Heisenberg category at central
charge zero the affine oriented Frobenius Brauer category AOB(A). It contains a
natural Frobenius algebra analogue of the oriented Brauer category, which we call
the oriented Frobenius Brauer category OB(A). Note that the Frobenius Heisenberg
category has been studied in [21, 24, 7] and as such, this central charge zero case is
1. INTRODUCTION 3
not original. However, in Chapter 4, we state and prove a number of relations which
follow from the defining relations of OB(A) and AOB(A). These relations are special
cases of those appearing in [24], but we are able to greatly simplify many of the proofs
for the charge zero case. We define, in Theorems 5.3.4 and 5.3.11, natural functors
OB(A) ! smod-glm n(A); AOB(A) ! End (smod-glm n(A));
where smod-glm n(A) denotes the monoidal supercategory of right supermodules for
the general linear Lie superalgebra with entries in the Frobenius superalgebra A.
When A = |, we recover the functors described above for glm n = glm n(|). On
the other hand, if A = Cl is the two-dimensional Clifford superalgebra, then glm n(Cl)
is isomorphic to the queer Lie superalgebra q(m+ n), and our functors recover those
defined in [3]. As in the A = | case, these functors extend Schur-Weyl duality results
for queer Lie superalgebras [28], actions of walled Brauer-Clifford superalgebras [14],
and actions of affine walled Brauer-Clifford superalgebras [3, 12]. In fact, the Clifford
superalgebra is the main example of interest where the Frobenius superalgebra is not
symmetric. Since this case has already been studied in the aforementioned papers, we
assume throughout the thesis that A is symmetric, as this simplifies the exposition.
We have indicated in Remark 4.1.6 the modification that needs to be made to handle
the more general case.
The results of this thesis, and the accompanying paper [18], extend the powerful
category theoretic tools that have been used to study the representation theory
of general linear Lie superalgebras and queer Lie superalgebras to the setting
of general linear Lie superalgebras over Frobenius superalgebras. For example, in
Proposition 5.3.12, we see that these functors yield central elements in the universal
enveloping algebra generalizing the known generators of this center in the A = | and
A = Cl cases. When A = |[x]=(xl), then glm n(A) is a truncated current superalgebra
(also called a Takiff algebra when m = 0 or n = 0). In this case, Brauer category
type methods do not seem to have appeared in the literature before.
The functors defined in Theorems 5.3.4 and 5.3.11 and several of the examples
contained in this thesis also appear in the paper, [18]. However, in this thesis we have
included additional details in the proofs of Theorems 5.3.4 and 5.3.11 and several of
the examples. Additionally, we have included the background knowledge necessary to
understand the concepts in this thesis and in [18], as well as proofs for the subsequent
relations in OB(A) and AOB(A). We have also included a review of classical Schur-
Weyl duality and some explanation of the connection to the rest of the thesis, which
does not appear in [18]. The exact content of the thesis is outlined in more detail
below.
1. INTRODUCTION 4
1.2 Overview of the Thesis
In Chapters 2 and 3 we cover the preliminaries such as vector superspaces, superalgebras,
supercategories, superfunctors, supernatural transformations, and Frobenius
superalgebras. We also introduce (symmetric) monoidal supercategories and string
diagrams. In Chapter 3 we also discuss in more detail some of the examples mentioned
in this introduction such as the two-dimensional Clifford superalgebra (Example 3.2.3)
and the supermatrix ring Matm n(A) (Example 3.2.2).
In Chapter 4 we introduce the affine oriented Frobenius Brauer categories and the
oriented Frobenius Brauer categories. We give their definition in terms of generators
and relations and prove a number of relations that follow. As mentioned, these
subsequent relations and their proofs are special cases of those appearing in [24]. We
also note which relations in particular correspond to certain properties of AOB(A)
and OB(A) such as rigidity, pivotality, and their symmetric monoidal structure (only
in the case of OB(A)). We also recall the Basis Theorem for AOB(A) from [7, Th. 7.2].
In Chapter 5 we introduce the category of right glm n(A)-supermodules and define
the functors mentioned above in Theorems 5.3.4 and 5.3.11.
Finally, in Chapter 6 we discuss the possible connection of the functors defined
in Theorems 5.3.4 and 5.3.11 to Schur-Weyl duality which is discussed more below.
1.3 Further Directions
In Chapter 6 we review classical Schur-Weyl duality and note the connection to
the functors defined in Theorems 5.3.4 and 5.3.11. We identify some examples of
Frobenius superalgebras where an analogue of the proof of classical Schur-Weyl duality
goes through as well as some examples where it may not.
Some additional possible further directions which we have not explored are listed
below.
1. Interpolating categories. The idempotent completion of OB(A) is a natural candidate
for an interpolating category for smod-glm n(A), which could potentially
be used to generalize work of Deligne and others in the case n = 0, A = |.
2. Frobenius Schur algebras. One should be able to define Schur algebras depending
on a Frobenius superalgebra A such that, when A = |, one recovers the usual
Schur algebras.
3. Cyclotomic quotients. In the cases A = | and A = Cl, cyclotomic quotients of
AOB(A) have been studied in [3, 4]. We expect that many of these results can
be extended to the setting of general Frobenius superalgebras.
1. INTRODUCTION 5
4. Quantum analogues. The quantum Frobenius Heisenberg categories, introduced
in [6], are natural quantum analogues of Frobenius Heisenberg categories. The
special case of central charge zero yields a natural quantum affine oriented
Frobenius Brauer category. When A = |, this is the affine HOMFLY-PT skein
category. Then quantum affine oriented Frobenius Brauer categories should
act on as-yet-to-be-defined quantum enveloping algebras of glm n(A) and yield
Frobenius analogues of the HOMFLY-PT link invariant.
Chapter 2
Monoidal Supercategories
In this chapter we introduce some basic category theoretic concepts and work up
towards symmetric monoidal supercategories. We give a brief overview of string
diagrams in the super setting, which will be needed in Chapter 4 and beyond.
2.1 Introduction to Supercategories
Throughout the thesis we will work over a ground field |. Unadorned tensor products
will be over |.
A |-vector superspace is a |-vector space, V , with a Z2-grading with decomposition
V = V0 x V1; 0; 1 2 Z2:
Note that | itself is a purely even vector superspace.
A nonzero homogeneous element v 2 Vi, has parity given by v = i. If v = 0, v
is said to be even and if v = 1, v is said to be odd. We can consider the category
of vector superspaces, SVec, where objects are vector superspaces and morphisms are
parity preserving linear maps between them. We say a linear map is even if it is
parity preserving and odd if it is parity reversing.
Definition 2.1.1. A supercategory, C, is a category enriched in SVec. This means
for each pair of objects, A;B 2 C, their morphism space, HomC(A;B), is a |-vector
superspace and composition is parity preserving, meaning f ffi g = f + g for f 2
HomC(B;C); g 2 HomC(A;B).
Example 2.1.2. It is immediate that SVec is a supercategory since composition of
even morphisms is again even.
Remark 2.1.3. Every category is a supercategory with purely even morphism spaces.
Definition 2.1.4. For supercategories C;D a superfunctor F : C ! D is a pair of
maps on objects and morphisms of C such that
6
2. MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES 7
• F1X = 1FX for X 2 C,
• F(g ffi f) = Fg ffi Ff for f 2 HomC(X; Y ); g 2 HomC(Y;Z), and
• Ff = f for f 2 HomC(X; Y ).
Note that the first two conditions above say that F is a functor from C to D and it
is the third condition that elevates F from a functor to a superfunctor.
Definition 2.1.5. For superfunctors F;G: A ! B, a supernatural transformation
ff: F ) G of parity r 2 Z2 is the data of morphisms ffX 2 HomB(FX;GX)r for each
X 2 A such that the following diagram commutes:
FX
(􀀀1)rfFf
FY
ffX
GX
Gf
GY
ffY ; (2.1.1)
that is Gf ffi ffX = (􀀀1)rfffY ffi Ff for each homogeneous f 2 HomA(X; Y ).
A supernatural transformation ff: F ) G is ff = ff0 + ff1 with each ffr being a
supernatural transformation of parity r.
A supernatural isomorphism is a supernatural transformation ff where each component
ffX is an isomorphism.
We can define composition of supernatural transformations in two ways. Let
F; G;H: A ! B be superfunctors. Let x : F ) G; ff: G ) H be supernatural
transformations. We can define a supernatural transformation ff x x : F ) H with
components
(ff x x)X := ffX ffi xX : FX ! HX;
for X 2 A where ffi is regular morphism composition in the category B. This is known
as vertical composition:
A B G
H
F
ff
x
= A B
H
F
ffxx .
Now let F;G: A ! B, H;K: B ! E be superfunctors. Let x : F ) G, ff: H )
K be supernatural transformations. We can define another composition ffx : HffiF )
K ffi G with components
(ffx)X := ffGX ffi H(xX) : HFX ! KGX;
2. MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES 8
for X 2 A, which is called horizontal composition:
A B E
G
F
x
K
H
ff = A E
KffiG
HffiF
ffx .
A natural question to ask is do these compositions commute. If we first compose
vertically and then horizontally we have
A B E G
H
F
G0
H0
F0
x
ff
x0
ff0
= A E
H0ffiH
F0ffiF
(ff0xx0)(ffxx)
while if we compose hortizontally and then vertically we have
A B E G
H
F
G0
H0
F0
x
ff
x0
ff0
= A E
H0ffiH
F0ffiF
(ff0ff)x(x0x) .
It turns out that the compositions commute up to a sign such that
(ff0ff) x (x0x) = (􀀀1)ffx0(ff0 x x0)(ff x x):
For simplicity, we assume that each supernatural transformation, ff; ff0; x; x0 is homogeneous
and then we can extend by linearity. Recall that by supernaturality of x0, for
X 2 A we have G0(ffX) ffi x0
GX = (􀀀1)rffXx0H X ffi F0ffX where r = x0. Note also that by
definition ffX = ff so that (􀀀1)rffX = (􀀀1)ffx0 . We have
((ff0ff) x (x0x))X = (ff0ff)X ffi (x0x)X
= ff0
HX ffi G0(ffX) ffi x0
GX ffi F0(xX)
= (􀀀1)ffx0ff0HX ffi x0
HX ffi F0(ffX) ffi F0(xX)
= (􀀀1)ffx0(ff0 x x0)HX ffi F0((ff x x)X)
= (􀀀1)ffx0 ((ff0 x x0)(ff x x))X :

Definition 2.1.6. A monoidal category is a category C equipped with a tensor product

 : CxC ! C and a unit object 1 such that for all A;B;C;D 2 C there are natural
isomorphisms with components ffA;B;C : A
(B
C) ! (A

C, xA : 1

and xA : A

These commutative diagrams are called the coherence conditions.
If ff; x; x are identities then C is called a strict monoidal category. To show ff; x; x
are identities, it suffices to show that for all objects A;B;C 2 C, A 
 (B 
 C) =
(A 
 B) 
 C, A 
 1 = A = 1 
 A and that for all morphisms f; g; h 2 Mor C,
f 
 (g 
 h) = (f 
 g) 
 h and f 
 id1 = f = id1 
f.
A monoidal supercategory is a supercategory with a superbifunctor 
 : CxC ! C
and unit object 1 subject to the same coherence conditions as above.
In a strict monoidal supercategory the coherence maps are again identities. Moreover,
in a strict monoidal supercategory composition of morphisms is given by
(f 
 g) ffi (h 
 k) = (􀀀1)gh(f ffi h) 
 (g ffi k): (2.1.5)
Equation (2.1.5) is known as the superinterchange law. For more on monoidal
supercategories, see [5]. Also note that (2.1.5) agrees with (2.1.2).
Example 2.1.7. The category of vector superspaces is a monoidal supercategory
with tensor product of vector superspaces and unit object |, the even one-dimensional
vector superspace.
Definition 2.1.8. A monoidal category C is called symmetric if there is a natural
isomorphism called a symmetric braiding with components sA;B : A
B ! B 
A for
A;B 2 C such that the following diagrams commute

still have that A

 A, we have a braided monoidal
category instead.

2.2 String Diagrams
We will give a brief overview of string diagrams in both the classical and super setting.
For another overview see [26], for more details see [29, Ch. 1, 2], and see [5] for the
super setting.
String diagrams are a way to visually represent morphisms in a monoidal supercategory.
For a morphism f 2 HomC(X; Y ) we can represent it as
2. MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES 12
f
Y
X
so that we read diagrams from bottom to top. When it is obvious or unimportant,
we omit the labels at the top and bottom of the diagram. We represent the identity
morphism by an empty strand
Y
X
:
We represent composition by vertically stacking
f
g
= fffig
and we represent the tensor product by horizontal  uxtaposition
f 
 g = f g :
Due to the super interchange law, (2.1.5), we need to be careful about the height
of morphisms in our diagrams:
f
g = f g = (􀀀1)fg
f
g : (2.2.1)
Instead of representing a morphism by a coupon, we may occasionally represent
it in other ways. For example, by orientation of a strand, a crossing, a token or dot:
; ; a ; :
In this thesis our morphisms will be represented by orientation and various decorations
on strands as pictured above.
Chapter 3
Frobenius Superalgebras
In this chapter we introduce the concepts of superalgebras as well as Frobenius algebras.
We provide some motivating examples such as the superalgebra of supermatrices
and the two-dimensional Clifford superalgebra.
3.1 Superalgebras
Recall the definition of a vector superspace given in Chapter 2. We can consider
applying a similar grading to an algebra to obtain a superalgebra.
Definition 3.1.1. An associative superalgebra, A, over a field | is a |-vector superspace
with decomposition
A = A0 x A1
such that AiA  x Ai+  . For homogeneous elements a; b 2 A, ab = a + b.
A superalgebra is said to be symmetric if for all homogeneous a; b 2 A, ab =
(􀀀1)abba:
In the remainder of the document, whenever we discuss the parity of an element,
a, we assume a 2 A is homogeneous. We also give definitions on homogeneous
elements and extend by linearity.
For superalgebras A = A0 x A1 and B = B0 x B1, multiplication in the superalgebra
A 
 B is defined by
(a0 
 b)(a 
 b0) = (􀀀1)aba0a 
 bb0 (3.1.1)
for a; a0 2 A, b; b0 2 B.
Definition 3.1.2. The center Z(A) is the subalgebra of A generated by all homogeneous
a 2 A such that
ab = (􀀀1)abba; for all homogeneous b 2 A (3.1.2)
13
3. FROBENIUS SUPERALGEBRAS 14
Definition 3.1.3. The cocenter C(A) is the quotient of A by the subspace spanned
by ab􀀀(􀀀1)abba for all homogeneous a; b 2 A. Note that in general C(A) is a vector
superspace, and not a superalgebra. For a 2 A, we let _a denote its canonical image
in C(A).
Example 3.1.4. Fix m; n 2 N. For 1 x i x m + n, define p(i) 2 Z2 by
p(i) =
(
0 if 1 x i x m;
1 if m + 1 x i x m + n:
(3.1.3)
For a superalgebra A, let Matm n(A) be the ring consisting of (m + n) x (m + n)
matrices with entries in A, where multiplication is given by matrix multiplication.
We can equip Matm n(A) with a Z2-grading which is defined as follows. For a 2 A
and 1 x i;   x m + n, let a(i; ) 2 Matm n(A) denote the matrix with a in the (i;  )
position and 0 in all other positions. Then, for homogeneous a 2 A, we define
a(i; ) = a + p(i) + p( ):
Since it is straightforward to see Matm n(A) is a vector superspace over |, to see
it is a superalgebra we only need to verify the multiplication respects the Z2 grading.
Recall for 1 x i;  ; r; s x m + n and homogeneous a; b 2 A, we have
a(i; )b(r;s) = ffi ;r(ab)(i;s):
Since the zero matrix is both even and odd, we only need to consider the case when
  = r. Then we have
a(i; )b( ;s) = (ab)(i;s)
= a + b + p(i) + p(s)
= a + p(i) + p( ) + b + p( ) + p(s)
= a(i; ) + b( ;s):
Example 3.1.5. The two-dimensional Clifford superalgebra Cl := hc : c2 = 1i is a
superalgebra with decomposition given by |x|c with c = 1. It is straightforward to
see the multiplication respects the Z2-grading since c2 = 1.
3.2 Introduction to Frobenius Superalgebras
Definition 3.2.1. Let tr : A ! | be a linear map. Let B be a basis for A. Then A
is said to be a Frobenius superalgebra if there exists a dual basis, B_ := fb_ : b 2 Bg
with respect to tr. That is:
tr(b_c) = ffib;c; b; c 2 B:
3. FROBENIUS SUPERALGEBRAS 15
Moreover, A is a symmetric Frobenius superalgebra if
tr(ab) = (􀀀1)ab tr(ba)
for all homogeneous a; b 2 A. For a (not necessarily symmetric) Frobenius superalgebra,
one can show that there is an automorphism   of A, called the Nakayama
automorphism (see [19, Sec. 2]), such that tr(ab) = (􀀀1)xaxb
tr(b (a)).
Note that traces are not unique (see Example 3.2.3) and in the non-super case,
any two traces are related by multiplying by an invertible element. For the super
setting see [20, Prop. 4.7].
The supertrace, str, of a matrix, M = (mi; ) 2 Matm n(A), is given by
str(M) =
mX+n
i=1
(􀀀1)p(i)mi;i:
If we write M as a block matrix instead, M =
x
M00 M01
M10 M11
x
2 Matm n(A), where M00
is m x m, M01 is m x n, M10 is n x m and M11 is n x n, then
str(M) = Tr(M00) 􀀀 Tr(M11)
where Tr is the usual trace of a matrix.
Example 3.2.2. For a symmetric Frobenius superalgebra A with trace map tr, the
superalgebra Matm n(A) is a symmetric Frobenius superalgebra with trace
trm n := tr ffi str : Matm n(A) ! |;
a(i; ) 7! ffii; (􀀀1)p(i) tr(a);
for 1 x i;   x m + n and a 2 A.
First note that if BA is a basis for A then Matm n(A) has basis
Bm n := fb(i; ) : b 2 BA; 1 x i;   x m + ng (3.2.1)
and we claim that
(b(i; ))_ = (􀀀1)p( )b_
( ;i): (3.2.2)
is a left dual basis. Note that, here and in what follows, we adopt the convention
that we apply the symbol _ before considering subscripts. Thus, for example, b_
(i; ) =
(b_)(i; ). We have
trm n((b(i; ))_c(r;s)) = trm n((􀀀1)p( )b_
( ;i)c(r;s))
= trm n((􀀀1)p( )ffii;r(b_c)( ;s))
3. FROBENIUS SUPERALGEBRAS 16
= (􀀀1)p( )ffii;rffi ;s(􀀀1)p( ) tr(b_c)
= ffii;rffi ;s tr(b_c) = ffii;rffi ;sffib;c
as desired. The fact that trm n is symmetric follows from the fact that tr is symmetric.
Thus Matm n(A) is a symmetric Frobenius superalgebra with trace map, trm n. Note
that Matm n(A) is also a Frobenius superalgebra with trace map tr ffiTr, where Tr is
the ordinary matrix trace, with dual basis given by
(b(i; ))_ = b_
 ;i:
To see this simply remove all the signs in the previous calculation and replace str
with Tr. However, it is not symmetric since in particular for 1 x i;   x m + n with
p(i) = 1 and p( ) = 0 we have
tr ffiTr(1(i; )1( ;i)) = tr ffiTr((1)(i;i))
= tr(1)
while
(􀀀1)1(i; )1( ;i) tr ffiTr(1( ;i)1(i; )) = (􀀀1)p(i) tr(1)
= 􀀀tr(1):
Example 3.2.3. The two-dimensional Clifford superalgebra, Cl, is a Frobenius superalgebra.
Here, up to scalar multiple, we have two choices for homogeneous tr : Cl ! |
which are defined on the basis and extended by linearity. We have parity preserving:
tr0(1) = 1 and tr0(c) = 0;
or parity reversing:
tr1(1) = 0 and tr1(c) = 1:
Note that if we choose tr1, Cl is a symmetric Frobenius superalgebra since we have
tr1(c x 1) = (􀀀1)c1 tr1(1 x c);
tr1(1 x 1) = (􀀀1)11 tr1(1 x 1)
tr1(c x c) = (􀀀1)cc tr1(c x c):
However, if we choose tr0, this is not the case since in particular
tr0(c x c) = tr0(1) = 1 6= 􀀀1 = (􀀀1)c tr0(c x c):
With tr0, we see that Cl has nontrivial Nakayama automorphism given by  (c) = 􀀀c
so that
tr0(c x c) = tr0(1) = 1 = (􀀀1)c tr0(c x  (c)):
3. FROBENIUS SUPERALGEBRAS 17
In the remainder of the document A will denote a symmetric Frobenius superalgebra
with parity preserving trace map tr : A ! |. Thus
tr(ab) = (􀀀1)ab tr(ba) = (􀀀1)a tr(ba) = (􀀀1)b tr(ba); a; b 2 A; (3.2.3)
where the second and third equalities follow from the fact that tr(ab) = 0 unless
a = b. The definition of a graded Frobenius superalgebra gives that A possesses a
homogeneous basis BA and a left dual basis fb_ : b 2 BAg such that
tr(b_c) = ffib;c; b; c 2 BA: (3.2.4)
It follows that, for all a 2 A, we have
a =

tr(b_a)b =

tr(ab)b_: (3.2.5)
Note that b = b_, and that the left dual basis to fb_ : b 2 BAg is given by
(b_)_ = (􀀀1)bb: (3.2.6)
Lemma 3.2.4. For all homogeneous a; c 2 A, we have

where, in the second equality, we used the fact that tr(e_abc) = 0 unless e+a+b+c = 0
to simply the exponent of 􀀀1.

Chapter 4
Affine Oriented Frobenius Brauer
Categories
In this chapter we introduce our main object of study: the affine oriented Frobenius
Brauer category and the oriented Frobenius category contained within it. As mentioned
in Chapter 1, AOB(A) is the charge 0 case of Heisk(A) studied in [21, 24, 7].
However, in our k = 0 case the category is symmetric monoidal. In this chapter
we define AOB(A) and OB(A) in terms of generators and relations and prove some
additional relations. We also discuss some of the properties of AOB(A) and OB(A)
such as rigidity, pivotality and the symmetric monoidal structure. We also recall the
basis theorem for AOB(A) from [7].
4.1 Definition
The affine oriented Frobenius Brauer category is the central charge k = 0 case of the
Frobenius Heisenberg category Heisk(A) introduced in [24] and further studied in [7].
Definition 4.1.1. The oriented Frobenius Brauer category OB(A) associated to the
graded Frobenius superalgebra A is the strict graded monoidal supercategory generated
by objects " and # and morphisms
: " 
 " ! " 
 " ; a : " ! " ; a 2 A;
: 1 ! # 
 "; : " 
 # ! 1;
subject to certain relations. We refer to the decorations representing a , a 2 A, as
tokens. The parity of a is a, and all the other generating morphisms are even. We
impose the following relations:
18
4. AFFINE ORIENTED FROBENIUS BRAUER CATEGORIES 19
1. Affine wreath product algebra relations:
1 = ; (4.1.1) x a + x b = xa+xb ; (4.1.2)
b
a
= ab ; (4.1.3)
a
=
a
; (4.1.4)
= ; (4.1.5) = ; (4.1.6)
for all a; b 2 A, x; x 2 |. It follows from (4.1.1) to (4.1.3) that the map
A ! EndAOB(A)("); a 7! a ;
is a superalgebra homomorphism and, also using the super interchange law, that
a
b = a b = (􀀀1)ab a
b
; (4.1.7) a = a ; (4.1.8)
for a; b 2 A.
2. Right adjunction relations: We impose the following relations:
= ; (4.1.9) = : (4.1.10)
3. Inversion relation: The morphism
:= (4.1.11)
is invertible so that
= ; = : (4.1.12)
The inversion relation means that there is another generating morphism that is
inverse to the right crossing:
We also define the left cups and caps
:= ; := ; (4.1.13)
and the downward crossing:
:= (4.1.14)
4. AFFINE ORIENTED FROBENIUS BRAUER CATEGORIES 20
Remark 4.1.2. The oriented Frobenius Brauer category can equivalently be described
as the strict |-linear monoidal category generated by "; #, and morphisms
; a ; ; ; ;
subject to (4.1.1) to (4.1.3), (4.1.5), (4.1.6), (4.1.8) to (4.1.10) and (4.1.12) as well as
= (4.1.15) = : (4.1.16)
In this case, the left crossing is defined as
:= : (4.1.17)
From the imposed relations above we are able to deduce a number of others,
which are detailed in Section 4.2. Define the teleporter
= = :=
X
b2BA
b
b_
(3.2.6)
=
X
b2BA
b_
b : (4.1.18)
We do not insist that the tokens in a teleporter (4.1.18) are drawn at the same
horizontal level. The convention when this is not the case is that b is on the higher
of the tokens and b_ is on the lower one. We will also draw teleporters in larger
diagrams. When doing so, we add a sign of (􀀀1)yb in front of the b summand in
(4.1.18), where y is the sum of the parities of all morphisms in the diagram vertically
between the tokens labeled b and b_. For example,
a
c =
X
b2BA
(􀀀1)(a+c)b
a
b c
b_
:
This convention ensures that one can slide the endpoints of teleporters along strands:
a
c = a
c = a
c = a
c :
We are able to set many of these conventions as a consequence of the trace map, tr.
For example, it follows from (3.2.7) that tokens can \teleport" across teleporters in
the sense that, for a 2 A, we have
a
=
a
;
a
=
a
;
a
=
a
;
a
=
a
: (4.1.19)
where the strings can occur anywhere in a diagram (i.e. they do not need to be
adacent). The endpoints of teleporters slide through crossings and they can teleport
too. For example we have
= ; = = : (4.1.20)
4. AFFINE ORIENTED FROBENIUS BRAUER CATEGORIES 21
Definition 4.1.3. The affine oriented Frobenius Brauer category AOB(A) associated
to the graded Frobenius superalgebra A is the graded monoidal supercategory
obtained from OB(A) by adjoining an even generator : "!", which we call a dot,
subject to the relations
􀀀 = ;
a
=
a
; a 2 A: (4.1.21)
It follows that we also have the relation
􀀀 = : (4.1.22)
Remark 4.1.4. If A is Z-graded where deg(tr) = 􀀀dA, the categories OB(A) and
AOB(A) are also naturally Z-graded where the degrees of the generating morphisms
are as follows:
deg ( a ) = deg(a); deg ( ) = deg ( ) = deg ( ) = 0:
All of the results of this thesis hold in the Z-graded setting.
Example 4.1.5. As noted in the introduction, when A = |, the categories OB(|) and
AOB(|) are the oriented Brauer and affine oriented Brauer categories, respectively;
see [4]. The endomorphism algebras of OB(|) are oriented Brauer algebras, which are
isomorphic to walled Brauer algebras.
Remark 4.1.6. The definitions of OB(A) and AOB(A) can be generalized to allow
for A to be a (not necessarily symmetric) Frobenius superalgebra with trace map of
arbitrary parity. The only change to the relations is that the parity of the dot is equal
to the parity tr of the trace map (i.e. the dot is odd if the trace map is parity reversing)
and the second relation in (4.1.21) becomes
a = (􀀀1)xatr
 (a) ; a 2 A;
where   is the Nakayama automorphism. (This level of generality was considered in
[24].) With this modification, we can take A to be the two-dimensional Clifford super-
algebra Cl; see Example 3.2.3. Then OB(Cl) and AOB(Cl) are the oriented Brauer{
Clifford and degenerate affine oriented Brauer{Clifford supercategories, respectively,
introduced in [3].
For n x 1, we denote the n-th power of by labelling the dot with the exponent
n:
n
= n :
4. AFFINE ORIENTED FROBENIUS BRAUER CATEGORIES 22
We adopt the following conventions for bubbles with a negative number of dots:
r a = 􀀀ffir;􀀀1 tr(a); (4.1.23)
a r = ffir;􀀀1 tr(a); (4.1.24)
for r < 0 and a 2 A.
4.2 Subsequent Relations
The following relations and their consequences are a result of the above imposed
relations on OB(A) and AOB(A). Relations not involving dots hold in both AOB(A)
and OB(A) while the dotted relations hold only in AOB(A).
4.2.1 Rigidity
A rigid category is a monodial category where every object has a left and right dual.
The right adjunction relations, (4.1.9) and (4.1.10), tell us that # is right dual to ".
We also have left adjunction relations and so # is left dual to " and OB(A) is a rigid
category. Before showing the left adjunction relations we will need a number of other
relations which all follow from the defining relations.
Lemma 4.2.1. The right pitchfork relations hold:
= ; (4.2.1) = ; (4.2.2)
= ; (4.2.3) = : (4.2.4)
Proof: To see (4.2.1) we have
=
(4.1.9)
= :
The remaining right pitchfork relations can be verified similarly.
We also have left pitchfork relations.
Lemma 4.2.2. The left pitchfork relations hold:
= ; (4.2.5) = ; (4.2.6)
= ; (4.2.7) = : (4.2.8)
4. AFFINE ORIENTED FROBENIUS BRAUER CATEGORIES 23
Proof: To verify (4.2.7) we first claim that
= : (4.2.9)
We have
(4.2.10)
=
(4.2.40)
=
(4.2.3)
=
(4.1.6)
(4.2.10)
= :
This completes the proof of (4.2.9). Now we have
(4.2.9)
=
(4.1.12)
= :
The proof of (4.2.8) is similar and (4.2.5) and (4.2.6) follow from Lemma 4.2.16.
In Definitions 4.1.1 and 4.1.3, we define the left cups and caps as right cups and
caps with crossings, in fact, we can view the right cups and caps in a similar way.
Lemma 4.2.3. The following relations hold:
= ; (4.2.10) = : (4.2.11)
Proof: To see (4.2.10) we have
(4.1.13)
=
(4.1.6)
= :
(4.2.11) follows from Lemma 4.2.16.
Now we can verify the left adjunction relations.
Lemma 4.2.4. The left adjunction relations hold:
= ; (4.2.12) = : (4.2.13)
Proof: To see (4.2.12) we have
(4.1.13)
=
(4.2.7)
=
(4.2.10)
=
(4.1.9)
= :
(4.2.12) follows by Lemma 4.2.16.
4. AFFINE ORIENTED FROBENIUS BRAUER CATEGORIES 24
4.2.2 Pivotality
A pivotal category is a rigid category with a natural isomorphism x(􀀀) ) (􀀀)x, where
x(􀀀) is the left dual functor sending each object and morphism to its left dual and
(􀀀)x is the right. In a strict pivotal category the above natural isomorphism is in
fact the identity. In Section 4.2.1 we saw that # is left and right dual to ", so to see
that OB(A) is strictly pivotal, we need to verify that the left and right dual of each
generating morphism are equal.
To this end we have the rotation relations. For all a 2 A,
a := a = a ; (4.2.14) := = ; (4.2.15)
:= = : (4.2.16)
Note that in (4.2.14) to (4.2.16) we take the first equalities as definitions and prove
the second equalities in Lemma 4.2.11. These definitions give us tokens and dots, in
addition to crossings, on downward strands.
Lemma 4.2.5. For all a 2 A,
= ; = ; (4.2.17) a = a ; a = a : (4.2.18)
Proof: The first relation in (4.2.17) can be verified as follows
(4.2.15)
=
(4.1.9)
= :
To see the first relation in (4.2.18) we have
a
(4.2.14)
= a (4.1.9)
= a :
The remaining relations follow from Lemma 4.2.16.
Lemma 4.2.6. There is an anti-homomorphism of superalgebras
A ! End #; a 7! a ; (4.2.19)
that is, a homomorphism
A ! (End #)op:
4. AFFINE ORIENTED FROBENIUS BRAUER CATEGORIES 25
Proof: It suffices to show

a = (􀀀1)ac

We have
c
a = a
c
(4.2.18)
= (􀀀1)ac a
c (4.1.10)
=
(4.1.3)
(􀀀1)ac ca
= (􀀀1)ac
ca
Attaching right caps to the top and right cups to the bottom of the affine wreath
product algebra relations gives the following relations for all a 2 A:
= ; (4.2.20) = : (4.2.21)
= ; (4.2.22) a = a ; (4.2.23)
a
=
a
; (4.2.24)

; (4.2.27)
􀀀 = ; (4.2.28) 􀀀 = ; (4.2.29)
􀀀 = ; (4.2.30) 􀀀 = : (4.2.31)
In addition to the above downwards and right crossing relations, we have some
similar ones for left crossings.
Lemma 4.2.7. We have
a
=
a
; (4.2.32)
a
=
a
: (4.2.33)
4. AFFINE ORIENTED FROBENIUS BRAUER CATEGORIES 26
Proof: To prove (4.2.32), first compose (4.2.24) on the top and bottom with the
left crossing as follows
a
=
a
.
Then using (4.1.12) on the top left and bottom right we have
a
=
a
as desired. The proof for (4.2.33) is similar beginning instead with (4.2.25).
Now we can show tokens can slide over left caps and cups.
Lemma 4.2.8. The left cup and cap token slide relations hold:
a = a ; (4.2.34) a = a : (4.2.35)
Proof: We prove the cap version and the cup version is similar. We have
a
(4.1.13)
=
a
(4.2.33)
= a
(4.2.18)
= a
(4.2.32)
=
a
(4.1.13)
= a :
We have similar results involving dots.
Lemma 4.2.9. The left dot slide relations hold:
􀀀 = ; (4.2.36) 􀀀 = : (4.2.37)
Proof: We prove (4.2.37), since (4.2.36) is similar. Composing (4.2.28) on the top
and bottom with we have
􀀀 =
(4.1.12)
=)
(4.1.13)
(4.2.18)
􀀀 :
Now we can show that dots can slide over left cups and caps:
4. AFFINE ORIENTED FROBENIUS BRAUER CATEGORIES 27
Lemma 4.2.10. The left cup and cap dot slide relations hold:
= ; (4.2.38) = : (4.2.39)
Proof: We prove (4.2.39), since (4.2.38) is similar. We have
(4.1.13)
=
(4.2.37)
=
(4.2.17)

(4.2.35)
(4.2.34)

(4.2.36)

Lemma 4.2.11. The rotation relations, (4.2.14) to (4.2.16), hold.
Proof: We have
a
(4.2.35)
= a
(4.2.12)
= a :
Similarly, (4.2.15) follows from (4.2.12) and (4.2.39) and (4.2.16) follows from (4.2.8)
and (4.2.12).
4.2.3 Symmetric Monoidal Structure
We have seen that for a number of our defining relations, they actually hold for all
orientations. This is also the case for the braid relations.
Lemma 4.2.12. We have the alternating braid relation:
= : (4.2.40)
Proof: We start with (4.2.21) and attach crossings to the top left and bottom
right pairs of strands to obtain
= : (4.2.41)
4. AFFINE ORIENTED FROBENIUS BRAUER CATEGORIES 28
Using (4.1.12) on the bottom left and the top right, (4.2.41) becomes
= :
Remark 4.2.13. We now have the braid relations for all orientations
= : (4.2.42)
Remark 4.2.14. The oriented Frobenius Brauer category, OB(A), is a symmetric
monoidal supercategory with symmetric braiding, s, given by the obvious diagram
crossing. For example, for A =""##" and B =#""#, sA
B is given by
:
To see OB(A) is symmetric, note that diagram (2.1.6) follows immediately and (2.1.8)
follows from (4.1.6), (4.1.12) and (4.2.22). Diagram (2.1.7) follows from associativ-
ity of the tensor product and supernaturality of the symmetric braiding follows from
(4.1.4), (4.1.8), (4.2.24) to (4.2.27), (4.2.32), (4.2.33) and (4.2.42).
Remark 4.2.15. The affine oriented Frobenius Brauer category, AOB(A) is not sym-
metric monoidal. In particular, rewriting
; (4.2.43)
using the basis D0(""; "") from Theorem 4.3.1, as well as (4.1.21), we have
; + ;
respectively. Then, we can conclude the two diagrams in (4.2.43) are not equal since
the coefficients are distinct when written in the basis and so AOB(A) is not symmetric
monoidal.
Lemma 4.2.16. There is an isomorphism of monoidal categories
!: AOB(A)
x= 􀀀! AOBop(
Aop)
(
4.2.44)
4. AFFINE ORIENTED FROBENIUS BRAUER CATEGORIES 29
interchanging the objects " and # and defined on the generating morphisms by
7! 􀀀 ; a 7! a ; 7! ;
7! ; 7! :
Proof: The functor ! preserves the affine wreath product algebra relations, the
right adjunction relations, and the inversion relations by (4.1.12), (4.2.12), (4.2.13),
(4.2.19), (4.2.22), (4.2.23), (4.2.27), (4.2.31) and (4.2.40). By (4.1.9) and (4.1.10) we
have
7! 􀀀 ; a 7! a ; 7! :
For example, to see a 7! a note that
!
x
a
x
= !
x
a
x
= a
(4.2.17)
= a
(4.1.9)
= a :
Thus !2 = id. Hence ! is an isomorphism.
Diagrammatically, ! re
ects diagrams in the horizontal axis, and then multiplies

the action of !.
4.2.4 Bubble Slide and Infinite Grassmanian Relations
We can generalize each of the dot slide relations, (4.1.22), (4.2.28) to (4.2.31), (4.2.36)
and (4.2.37) for an arbitrary number of dots. We give the proof for (4.1.21) and the
rest are similar. These general relations are needed in the proof of the bubble slide
relations, (4.2.49) and (4.2.50).
Lemma 4.2.17. The following generalization of (4.1.21) holds for a 2 A and t x 1:
t

X
r;sx0
r+s=t􀀀1
r s : (4.2.45)
Proof: We proceed by induction. In the case t = 1 we arrive at (4.1.21). Suppose
the result holds for t x 1. We have

For any homogeneous a 2 A, we define
ay :=

(􀀀1)abbab_; (4.2.46)
which is well-defined independent of the choice of the basis BA. First we prove the
curl relations, which are needed in the proof of (4.2.49) and (4.2.50).
Proposition 4.2.18. For all r x 0, we have the curl relations:
r =

X

and (4.1.24), the bubbles will be 0 whenever s > r.

Placing an upward strand on the right,  oining the bottom of the two rightmost
strands with a right cup, and using (4.1.9) gives (4.2.47). Relation (4.2.48) is obtained
similarly.
Note that taking r = 0 in (4.2.47) and (4.2.48), using (4.1.23) and (4.1.24), we arrive
at (4.1.15) and (4.1.16) from the alternate definition of OB(A) in Remark 4.1.2.

It suffices to prove (4.2.50), since then (4.2.49) follows by applying ! from
Lemma 4.2.16, placing upward strands to the left and right of all diagrams, connecting
the tops of the two leftmost straight strands with a right cap, connecting
the bottoms of the rightmost strands with a right cup, and using (4.1.9), (4.2.17)

Proposition 4.2.20. We have the infinite Grassmannian relation:
X

Proof: First note that the sum is finite since by (4.1.23) and (4.1.24), whenever
r < 0 or s < 0, the left and right dotted bubbles will be 0, respectively. Thus we are
only summing over non negative r and s and are bounded above by n.
By (3.2.7), we can consider the case when b = 1. When n = 0, the left of (4.2.51)

4.3 The Basis Theorem
We next recall the basis theorem for AOB(A).
We define Sym(A) to be the symmetric superalgebra generated by the vector
superspace C(A)[x], where x here is an even indeterminate. Recall that for a 2 A, we
let _a denote its canonical image in C(A). For n 2 Z and a 2 A, let en(a) 2 Sym(A)
denote
en(a) :=
8><
>:
0 if n < 0;
tr(a) if n = 0;
_axn􀀀1 if n > 0:
(4.3.1)
Since tr is parity-preserving, this defines a parity-preserving linear map en : A !
Sym(A). By [7, Lem. 7.1], for each n 2 Z there is a unique parity-preserving linear
map hn : A ! Sym(A) such that
X
r+s=n
X
c2BA
(􀀀1)rer(ac)hr􀀀s(c_b) = ffin;0 tr(ab); for all a; b 2 A (4.3.2)
and hn(a) = 0 for a 2 A and n < 0.
In the special case that A = |, Sym(A) may be identified with the algebra
of symmetric functions so that en(1) corresponds to the n-th elementary symmetric
function and hn(1) corresponds to the n-th complete symmetric function.
We have a homomorphism of superalgebras
fi : Sym(A) ! EndAOB(A)(1);
en(a) 7! (􀀀1)n􀀀1
a n􀀀1 ;
hn(a) 7! n􀀀1 a ; n x 1:
(4.3.3)
To see this is a superalgebra homomorphism, since the en(a); hn(a) generate
Sym(A) as a superalgebra and (4.3.2) allows us to write the hn in terms of the en, it
4. AFFINE ORIENTED FROBENIUS BRAUER CATEGORIES 34
suffices to show (4.3.2) holds in EndAOB(A)(1). Under fi, we have that

Let X = Xn 
 x x x 
 X1 and Y = Ym 
 x x x 
 Y1 be objects of AOB(A) for
Xi; Y  2 f"; #g. An (X; Y )-matching is a biection between the sets
fi : Xi ="g t f  : Y  =#g and fi : Xi =#g t f  : Y  ="g:
A reduced lift of an (X; Y )-matching is a string diagram representing a morphism
X ! Y such that
• the endpoints of each string are points which correspond under the given matching;
• there are no 
oating bubbles and no dots or tokens on any string;
• there are no self-intersections of strings and no two strings cross each other more
than once.
For each (X; Y ) matching, fix a set D(X; Y ) consisting of a choice of reduced lift for
each (X; Y )-matching. Then let Dffi(X; Y ) denote the set of all morphisms that can
be obtained from the elements of D(X; Y ) by adding a nonnegative number of dots
and one element of BA near to the terminus of each string (i.e. such that there are
no crossings between the terminus and the dots and elements of BA).
Using the homomorphism fi from (4.3.3), we have that, for X; Y 2 AOB(A),
HomAOB(A)(X; Y ) is a right Sym(A)-supermodule under the action
xx := x 
 fi(x); x 2 HomAOB(A)(X; Y ); x 2 Sym(A):
Theorem 4.3.1 ([7, Th. 7.2]). For X; Y 2 AOB(A), the morphism space HomAOB(A)(X; Y )
is a free right Sym(A)-supermodule with basis Dffi(X; Y ).
It follows from Theorem 4.3.1 that the map (4.3.3) is an isomorphism of superalgebras.
Taking n = 1 in (4.2.51) and using (4.1.23), (3.2.5) and (4.1.24) gives
a = a for all a 2 A: (4.3.4)
4. AFFINE ORIENTED FROBENIUS BRAUER CATEGORIES 35
It follows from the bubble slide relations (4.2.49) and (4.2.50) these bubbles, which
have the same degree and parity as a, are strictly central:
a = a and a = a :
For further discussion of the above bubbles see [24, Sec. 1].
For any linear map x : C(A) ! |, we can define the specialized oriented Frobenius
Brauer category OB(A; x) by imposing on OB(A) the additional relation
a = x(a); a 2 A: (4.3.5)
Similarly, we can define the specialized affine oriented Frobenius Brauer category
AOB(A; x) by imposing on AOB(A) the relation (4.3.5). We will see in (5.3.7) that,
under the categorical action to be defined in Chapter 5, the bubbles (4.3.4) act by
multiplication by the supertrace of the map V+ ! V+, v 7! av. Hence these actions
factor through the corresponding specialized categories.
Chapter 5
Categorical Action
In this chapter we work towards defining the categorical action of AOB(A) and OB(A)
on the general linear Lie superalgebra. When k 6= 0, the category Heisk(A) acts naturally
on categories of modules over the cyclotomic wreath product algebras defined
in [25] and so in this chapter, we fill in the gap and consider the natural action in the
k = 0 case.
5.1 General Linear Lie Superalgebra
Let g denote the Lie superalgebra associated to Matm n(A). Precisely, g is equal to
Matm n(A) as a |-supermodule and the Lie superbracket is defined by
[M;N] = MN 􀀀 (􀀀1)MNNM:
for homogeneous M;N 2 g and extended by linearity.
Example 5.1.1. When A = |, g is the usual general linear superalgebra over |.
Example 5.1.2. When A = |[t]=(t`), ` x 2, g = glm n(A) is a truncated current
superalgebra. When n = 0, g is a Takiff algebra.
Example 5.1.3. When A = Cl (see Example 3.2.3), g is the queer Lie superalgebra.
The queer Lie superalgebra, q(n), has even and odd parts

where Matn(|) denotes the set of n x n matrices with entries in |. Then we have an

5.2 Supercategory of Right g-Supermodules
Let Am n denote the |-supermodule equal to Am+n as a |-module, with Z2-grading
determined by
aei = a + p(i);
where ei, 1 x i x m + n, denotes the element of Am n with a 1 in the i-th entry and
all other entries equal to 0. We will also consider Am n as a left A-module with action
a(a1; : : : ; am+n) = (aa1; : : : ; aam+n):
Definition 5.2.1. A right supermodule, W, over a Lie superalgebra, L, is a |-vector
space with a |-bilinear map W x L ! W, (w;X) 7! wX such that
WiL  x Wi+  ; i;   2 Z2;
and
w[X; Y ] = (wX)Y 􀀀 (􀀀1)XY (wY )X; X; Y 2 L;w 2 W:
5. CATEGORICAL ACTION 38
Definition 5.2.2. For a Lie superalgebra L and right L-supermodules, V and W, a
right L-supermodule homomorphism is a linear map f : V ! W such that f(vX) =
f(v)X for v 2 V;X 2 L.
Let smod-g denote the category of right g-supermodules where objects are right
g-supermodules and morphisms are linear maps between them.
Remark 5.2.3. We can also define the smaller category of right g-supermodules
where objects are right g-supermodules and morphisms are purely even maps between
them. This category is a monoidal category with tensor product of supermodules.
Lemma 5.2.4. The category of right g-supermodules, smod-g, is a monoidal super-
category with tensor product of supermodules such that
(m 
 n) x X = (􀀀1)nXm x X 
 n + m 
 n x X
for m
 n 2 M 
 N, M;N 2 smod-g, X 2 g and trivial object | where k x X = 0 for
X 2 g and k 2 |.
Proof: First we need to verify that for right g-supermodules, M;N, their tensor
product, M 
 N is once again a right g-supermodule.
It is straightforward to see M 
 N is a |-vector superspace, so it remains to
verify
(m 
 n)[X; Y ] = ((m 
 n)X)Y 􀀀 (􀀀1)XY ((m 
 n)Y )X
for m 
 n 2 M 
 N, M;N 2 smod-g; X; Y 2 g. We have
(m 
 n)[X; Y ] = (􀀀1)n(X+Y )m[X; Y ]

Any morphism x : M ! N can be decomposed into parity preserving and parity
reversing morphisms x = x0 + x1 where
x0(m) =
(
x(m); x(m) = m;
0; x(m) = m + 1
and
x1(m) =
(
x(m); x(m) = m + 1;
0; x(m) = m
5. CATEGORICAL ACTION 39
for homogeneous m 2 M. To see x0 is indeed a morphism note that for m 2 M;X 2 g
we have
x0(mX) =
(
x(mX); x(mX) = m + X;
0; x(mX) = m + X + 1
=
(
x(m)X; x(m)X = m + X;
0; x(m)X = m + X + 1
=
(
x(m)X; x(m) + X = m + X;
0; x(m) + X = m + X + 1
=
(
x(m)X; x(m) = m;
0; x(m) = m + 1
= x0(m)X:
To see x1 is a morphism note that x1 = x 􀀀 x0. So the morphism spaces are vector
superspaces and smod-g is a supercategory.
Associativity of 
, or the fact that diagram (2.1.3) commutes, follows from associativity
of the tensor product of supermodules. The fact that 
 is unital, or the
fact that diagram (2.1.4) commutes, follows from the natural isomorphisms
xM : | 
M ! M;
k 
 m 7! mk;
xM : M 
 | ! M;
m 
 k 7! mk:
(5.2.1)
We will verify x is a supernatural isomorphism and the proof for x is similar. We
need to verify that x is natural in M and each component, xM, is indeed a right
g-supermodule isomorphism. It is immediate xM is biective. We have that
xM((k
m)X) = x((􀀀1)mXkX
m+k
mX) = xM(k
mX) = mX = (xM(k
M))X
for X 2 g and
xM(k 
 m) = km = k + m = k 
 m:
Moreover, for M;N 2 smod-g and f : M ! N we have
M

5. CATEGORICAL ACTION 40
since f(xM(m
k)) = f(km) = kf(m) = xN(f(m)
k) = (􀀀1)rfxN ffi (f 
1|)(m
k)
since r = 0. Thus xM is indeed natural in M. So xM is a right g-supermodule homomorphism.
Remark 5.2.5. When working with commuting actions of superalgebras, it is most
natural to work with one left action and one right action, as this avoids signs arising
from the actions of the two algebras commuting past one another. Since we will want
the category introduced in Chapter 4 to act on the left, we choose to work with right
g-supermodules. The reader who wishes to work with left g-supermodules instead can
use the standard equivalence between the categories of right and left supermodules.
Precisely, if V is a right g-supermodule, then it becomes a left g-module with action
given by X x v := 􀀀(􀀀1)XvvX, X 2 g, v 2 V . For example, see Lemma 5.3.1.
5.3 Categorical Action of AOB(A) and OB(A)
Let V+ = Am n, written as row matrices, and let V􀀀 = Am n, written as column
matrices. Then V+ is naturally a right g-supermodule with action given by right
matrix multiplication.
Lemma 5.3.1. We have that V􀀀 is a right g-supermodule with action
v xM := 􀀀(􀀀1)vMMv; v 2 V􀀀: (5.3.1)
Proof: For v 2 V􀀀 and M;N 2 g, we have
v x [M;N] = (v xM) x N 􀀀 (􀀀1)MN(v x N) xM
= (􀀀1)v(M+N)+MNNMv 􀀀 (􀀀1)v(M+N)MNv

Lemma 5.3.2. The |-bilinear form
B: V􀀀

For a 2 A and 1 x i x m + n, let ai; denote the element of V with a in the
i-th position and 0 in every other position. Then
B+ := fbi;+ : b 2 BA; 1 x i x m + ng (5.3.2)
and
B􀀀 := fb_
i;􀀀 : b 2 BA; 1 x i x m + ng (5.3.3)
are dual bases of V+ and V􀀀 with respect to the bilinear form B. For v = bi;+ 2 B+,
let v_ = (􀀀1)p(i)b_
i;􀀀 2 B􀀀. Note that bi;+ = b_
i;􀀀 = b + p(i). Thus, we have
B(v_ 
 w) = ffiv;w; v;w 2 B+: (5.3.4)
To see this let 1 x i;   x m + n and a; b 2 BA. Then we have

Theorem 5.3.4. There is a monoidal superfunctor  : OB(A) ! smod-g that sends
the objects of OB(A) to objects of smod-g as follows
" 7! V+ ; # 7! V􀀀
and the generating morphisms as follows

Proof: We need to verify that the image of each generating morphism above is
a right g-supermodule homomorphism and that relations (4.1.4) to (4.1.6), (4.1.9),
(4.1.10) and (4.1.12) hold in smod-g.
5. CATEGORICAL ACTION 43
We begin with showing the images of the generating morphisms are right g-
supermodule homomorphisms. For  ( ), note that linearity follows from linearity
of the tensor product and for u; v 2 V+;M 2 g we have
 ( )(u 
 v)M = ((􀀀1)uvv 
 u)M
= (􀀀1)uv((􀀀1)uMvM 
 u + v 
 uM)
= (􀀀1)uv+uMvM 
 u + (􀀀1)vM+vu+vMv 
 uM
= (􀀀1)uvMvM 
 u + (􀀀1)vM(􀀀1)uMvv 
 uM
=  ( )

u 
 vM + (􀀀1)vMuM 
 v
x
=  ( )((u 
 v)M)
so  ( ) is a right g-supermodule homomorphism. The case is similar for  ( ). For
 ( a ), linearity is immediate and we have that
 ( a )(v)M = (av)M = avM =  ( a )(vM):
The fact that  ( ) is a right g-supermodule homomorphism follows from Lemma 5.3.2.
Let a 2 A and 1 x r; s x m + n. To see  ( ) is a right g-supermodule we have

where in the sixth equality we use the fact that
P

b_ 
b is independent of basis
and so we are free to instead sum over the dual basis.
Now we verify that each of the generating relations of OB(A) hold in smod-g.
The image of the left of (4.1.4) is given by
u 
 v 7! au 
 v 7! (􀀀1)auvv 
 au = (􀀀1)(a+u)vv 
 au
and the right by
u 
 v 7! (􀀀1)uvv 
 u 7! (􀀀1)uv+avv 
 au:
So we have (4.1.4). For (4.1.5) on the left we have
u 
 v 
 w 7! (􀀀1)uvv 
 u 
 w 7! (􀀀1)uv+uwv 
 w 
 u 7! (􀀀1)uv+uw+vww 
 v 
 u
and on the right
u 
 v 
 w 7! (􀀀1)vwu 
 w 
 v 7! (􀀀1)uw+vww 
 u 
 v 7! (􀀀1)uv+uw+vww 
 v 
 u:
Therefore the braid relation holds. The image under   of the right of relation (4.1.6)
is given by
u 
 v 7! (􀀀1)vuv 
 u 7! u 
 v
so relation (4.1.6) holds. Applying   to the left of relation (4.1.9) we have
u 
 1 7!
X
v2B+
(􀀀1)vu 
 v_ 
 v 7!
X
v2B+
(􀀀1)v+uvB(v_

and we have that

(􀀀1)v+uvB(v_ 
 u) 
 v =

v2B+
(􀀀1)v tr(uv_) 
 v
(3.2.3)
=
X
v2B+
tr(v_u) 
 v
(3.2.5)
= u:
Therefore relation (4.1.9) holds. The proof for relation (4.1.10) is similar. To verify
(4.1.12) first note that applying   to (4.1.11) we have
V+ 
 V􀀀 ! V􀀀 
 V+; u 
 w 7! (􀀀1)uww 
 u:
So (4.1.12) is immediate. So we have verified the defining relations and so smod-g is
a monoidal supercategory.
5. CATEGORICAL ACTION 45
Remark 5.3.5. Note that the image of each generating morphism, except  ( a ), is
an even g-supermodule homomorphism since
u 
 v = u + v = v 
 u = (􀀀1)uvv 
 u =  ( )(u 
 v) =  ( )(u 
 v);
x1
= 0 =
X
v2B+
v + v =
X
v2B+
(􀀀1)vv_ 
 v =  ( )(1);
and it is immediate  ( ) is even since tr is parity preserving. However
 ( a )(v) = av = a + v 6= v; for a = 1:
Thus, since  ( a ) is not always purely even, we need the larger supercategory smod-g,
instead of the category of right g-supermodules where morphisms are purely even ho-
momorphisms.
Remark 5.3.6. To use the alternate definition of OB(A) in Remark 4.1.2 we main-
tain the above definition of  , remove the definition on and add in that

X
v2B+

 ( ) : V􀀀 
 V+ ! |; v

Then, in addition to the relations we verified above, we also check (4.1.15) and (4.1.16).
Moreover, we note that the image of the definition of the left crossing, (4.1.17) under
 , which is given by u 
 w 7! (􀀀1)uww 
 v, is the same as the definition of   on .
For (4.1.15) we have

The proof for relation (4.1.16) is similar. Also note that the image of (4.1.13) under

Definition 5.3.7. Let C be a supercategory. The supercategory of endofunctors of
C, denoted End |(C), consists of super endofunctors F : C ! C, and morphisms which
are supernatural transformations between super endofunctors.
Lemma 5.3.8. The supercategory of endofunctors End |(C) is a strict monoidal su-
percategory for any supercategory C with tensor product denoted by x and unit object
idC. This tensor product, x : End |(C) x End |(C) ! End |(C), is defined as regular
composition on objects and as horizontal composition on morphisms.
Proof: First we show that End |(C) is indeed a supercategory. It is straightforward
to see the morphism spaces are vector superspaces because supernatural transformations
are defined to be the sum of an odd and even supernatural transformation
as in Definition 2.1.5. It is also straightforward to see composition of supernatural
transformations preserves parity since for homogenous supernatural transformations
ff : F ) G, fi : H ) K we have
(fffi)X = ffKX ffi F(fiX) = ffKX + F(fiX) = ff + fi;
for X 2 C.
Now, to verify End |(C) is strict monoidal, we need to verify that the supernatural
isomorphisms ff; x; x from Definition 2.1.6 are identities. First we show that
composition of objects of End |(C) is associative and unital. This follows immediately
since composition of functors is associative and unital. Then, we show that composition
of morphisms is associative and unital. For all supernatural transformations
ff: F ) G; fi : H ) K; 
 :   ) L of End |(C) and X 2 C we have
((fffi)
)X = (fffi)LX ffi F(H(
X))
= ffKLX ffi F(fiLX) ffi F(H(
X))
= ffKLX ffi F(fiLX ffi H(
X))
= ffKLX ffi F((fi
)X)
= ff(fi
):
5. CATEGORICAL ACTION 47
So we have associativity. The morphism identity is the identity supernatural transformation,
id : idC ! idC. For ff: F ! G and X 2 C we have
(ff id)X = ffidC(X) ffi F(idX)
= ffX ffi idFX
= ffX:
The proof that (id ff)X = ffX is similar. Thus End |(C) is a strict monoidal supercategory
for any supercategory C.
Theorem 5.3.9. Let C and D be monoidal supercategories. For a monoidal super-
functor  : C ! D there is an induced monoidal superfunctor
	: C ! End |(D)
X 7!  (X) 
D 􀀀;
f 7!  (f) 
D 􀀀;
(5.3.9)
where
	(X)(Y ) =  (X) 
D Y; 	(X)(g) = 1 (X) 
D g
for Y 2 D, g 2 MorD and for f 2 HomC(A;B), 	(f) : 	A ! 	B has components
given by 	(f)Y : 	(A)(Y ) ! 	(B)(Y ), 	(f)Y =  (f) 
D 1Y :
Proof: First we show 	 is a superfunctor. That is, 	 preserves composition,
	(f) = f and that 	(1X) = 1	(X). For f 2 HomC(A;B); g 2 HomC(B;C) and
Y 2 D we have
	(g ffi f)Y =  (g ffi f) 
D 1Y
= ( (g) ffi  (f)) 
D (1Y ffi 1Y )
= ( (g) 
D 1Y ) ffi ( (f) 
D 1Y )
= 	(g)Y ffi 	(f)Y ;
where the second line follows from the fact that   is a superfunctor and the third line
follows from the superinterchange law (2.1.5) and the fact that 1Y = 0. We have
	(1X)Y =  (1X) 
D 1Y = 1 (X) 
D 1Y = 1 (X)
DY :
Finally, we have that
	(f)Y =  (f) 
D 1Y =  (f) + 1Y = f + 0 = f:
So 	 is a superfunctor.
5. CATEGORICAL ACTION 48
To see 	 is a monoidal superfunctor, recall the coherence maps, x and x, from
Definition 2.1.10. We need to show xX;Y : 	(X) 
End |(D) 	(Y ) ! 	(X 
C Y ) is
an even supernatural isomorphism and x : 1End |(D) ! 	(1C) is an even invertible
morphism, such that the appropriate diagrams commute. For x, it suffices to show
	(X)
End |(D) 	(Y ) ' 	(X 
C Y ), and for x, that 1End |(D) ' 	(1C) for all X; Y 2 C.
It is immediate that parity is preserved across these isomorphisms since 	 and   are
superfunctors and thus preserve parity.
We have
(	(X) 
End |(D) 	(Y ))(Z) = 	(X)(	(Y )(Z))
= 	(X)( (Y ) 
D Z)
=  (X) 
D ( (Y ) 
D Z)
' ( (X) 
D  (Y )) 
D Z
'  (X 
C Y ) 
D Z
= 	(X 
C Y )(Z)
where the first isomorphism follows from the fact that D is a monoidal category, and
the second from the fact that   is a monoidal superfunctor. We also have
	(1C)(Z) =  (1C) 
D Z ' 1D 
D Z ' Z = 1End |(D)(Z)
where the first isomorphism follows from the fact that   is a monoidal functor, and
the second from the fact that D is a monoidal category. From these isomorphisms
and the fact that D and   are monoidal, it is straightforward to check that the appropriate
diagrams in Definition 2.1.10 commute. So 	 is a monoidal superfunctor.
Remark 5.3.10. Using the notation in Theorem 5.3.9, if   is a strict monoidal
superfunctor (and C;D are strict monoidal categories), the induced functor, 	 is also
strict monoidal. In this case, the isomorphisms in the proof above are replaced by
equalities.
Theorem 5.3.11. We have a strict monoidal superfunctor 	: AOB(A) ! End |(smod-g)

5. CATEGORICAL ACTION 49
Proof: In light of Theorem 5.3.4 and Theorem 5.3.9, it suffices to check that 	( )
is a supernatural transformation and that 	 respects the relations (4.1.21).
First we show 	( ) is a supernatural transformation. Note that is purely even,
so 	( ) is also even. This means there are no signs appearing in the supernaturality
diagram (2.1.1) for 	( ). Let W; Y 2 smod-g, f : W ! Y , v 2 V+; and w 2 W. We

When A = |, Theorems 5.3.4 and 5.3.11 recover known results for glm n =
glm n(|). Furthermore, as noted in Remark 4.1.6, the definitions of OB(A) and
AOB(A) can be generalized to allow A to be the two-dimensional Clifford superalgebra.
In this case, the actions described in Theorems 5.3.4 and 5.3.11 correspond
to those described in [3, §4.2 and Th. 4.4] on supermodules for the queer Lie superalgebra
(see Example 3.2.3).
The center Z(End (smod-g)) := EndEnd (smod-g)(1) of the category End (smod-g)
can be naturally identified with Z(U(g)) via the map

Chapter 6
Further Directions: Schur-Weyl
Duality
In this chapter we review classical Schur-Weyl duality and show that we have commuting
actions of U(g) and the wreath product superalgebra on V 
k where V = Am n.
A super analogue of Schur-Weyl duality was estabilished by Berele-Regev and Sergeev
in [1] and [27], respectively, for queer Lie superalgebras and Sergeev algebras. We
see that in the Frobenius superalgebra analogue, the action of the wreath product
superalgebra, which replaces the symmetric group in the classical version, is contained
in the endomorphism algebra EndOB(A)("
k). The functors defined in Theorems
5.3.4 and 5.3.11 extend Schur{Weyl duality results for queer Lie superalgebras
[28], actions of walled Brauer{Clifford superalgebras [14], and actions of affine walled
Brauer{Clifford superalgebras [3, 12] although the case for Frobenius superalgebras
is left open.
6.1 Classical Schur-Weyl Duality
Let V = |n, where | is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. In classical
Schur-Weyl duality, the symmetric group Sk acts on V 
k on the left as follows
(v1 
 x x x 
 vk) = v􀀀1(1) 
 x x x 
 v􀀀1(k);  2 Sk; v1; : : : ; vk 2 V;
and the general linear Lie algebra, gln(V ), acts on V 
k on the right as
(v1 
 x x x 
 vk) x X =
Xk
i=1
v1 
 x x x 
 viX 
 x x x 
 vk; X 2 gln(V ); v1; : : : ; vk 2 V:
It is straightforward to verify these actions commute. Schur-Weyl duality states
that |Sk and gln(V ) generate each other's commutants in the endomorphism algebra,
End|(V 
k). That is |Sk generates Endgln(V )(V 
k) and gln(V ) generates

6. FURTHER DIRECTIONS: SCHUR-WEYL DUALITY 53
End|Sk(V 
k). Equivalently, we may apply the following theorem to attain another
statement of Schur-Weyl duality.
Theorem 6.1.1 (Double Centralizer Theorem, [11, Thm. 4.54]). Let W be a finite
dimensional vector space over |, A be a semisimple subalgebra of End(W) such that
W is a finite direct sum of simple A-modules and B = EndA(W). Then
1. B is semisimple,
2. A = EndB(W),
3. as an A 
 B-module we have the decomposition
W '
M
Ui 
Wi (6.1.1)
where Ui are pairwise non-isomorphic simple modules of A and Wi := HomA(Ui;W)
are simple modules of B.
Using the notation of Theorem 6.1.1, let W = V 
k, A = |Sk and B =
EndSk(V 
k). Then by Item 3, V 
k decomposes as a direct sum of representations of
Sk x gln(V ),
V 
k '
M
x`k
Vx 
 Lx;
where x ` k means that x is an integer partition of k, the Vx are irreducible representations
of Sk and the Lx = Hom|Sk(Vx; V ) are irreducible representations of gln(V )
or zero when the number of parts in the partition x is greater than n. For further
details see [11, Thm. 4,57].
6.2 The Frobenius Superalgebra Analogue
Now, let V = Am n. Recall the Lie superalgebra g from Section 5.1 and that V = Am n
is a right g-supermodule. Since smod-g is a monoidal category, it follows that V 
k is
also a right g-supermodule with action given by
(vk 
 x x x 
 v1) x X =

i=1

for homogenous vk; : : : ; v1 2 V and X 2 g.
Definition 6.2.1. The wreath superalgebra A
koSk is the vector superspace A

|
|Sk with multiplication given by
(a 
 )(b 
  ) = a(b) 
  a; b 2 A
k; ;  2 Sk;
and extended by linearity.
6. FURTHER DIRECTIONS: SCHUR-WEYL DUALITY 54
Note that the wreath product superalgebra is generated as a superalgebra by
A
k and |Sk. Let ai := 1 
 x x x 
 1 
 a 
 1 
 x x x 
 1 2 A
k where a 2 A is
in the ith position. It follows from Theorem 4.3.1 that the following superalgebra
homomorphism is inective
x : A

Composing (6.2.2) with   from Theorem 5.3.4 we obtain an action map
A

given by

on homogenous elements and extended by linearity. Thus we have a left A

action on the superspace V

have
A

(6.2.3)
􀀀􀀀􀀀! End|(V

(6.2.1)
 􀀀􀀀􀀀 U(g)
To show that the image of g in End|(V 
k) under the action map corresponding to
(6.2.1) is EndA
koSk(V 
k), we can follow a modified version of the usual proof for
classical Schur-Weyl duality. Then, in the case that A is a semisimple superalgebra,
by [13, Claim 4.22], A
k oSk is also semisimple, so we can apply Theorem 6.1.1, to
see that (6.2.3) is an isomorphism and obtain Schur-Weyl duality. There are several
examples where A is semisimple and we believe a Schur-Weyl duality result holds.
Example 6.2.2. When A = | we recover classical Schur-Weyl duality where A
k o
Sk = |Sk, which is semisimple by Maschke's Theorem when char(|) does not divide
k.
Example 6.2.3. In fact, for any finite group G with  G  not divisible by char(|),
A = |G is a semisimple algebra by Maschke's Theorem and so A
koSk is semisimple.
Example 6.2.4. The two-dimensional Clifford superalgebra, Cl, from Example 3.2.3,
is a central simple superalgebra. So when A = Cl, A
k o Sk is the Sergeev algebra
of [27] and is semisimple.
However, there are many interesting cases where A
k o Sk is not semisimple.
6. FURTHER DIRECTIONS: SCHUR-WEYL DUALITY 55
Example 6.2.5. Let A = |[t]=(t`) for ` x 2 as in Example 5.1.2. Note that the ideal
I = (t) is nonzero but I` = 0, so I is nilpotent. Therefore A is not semisimple and so
A
k o Sk is not semisimple.
In the case where we do not assume A is semisimple, whether or not Schur-Weyl
duality holds is open. To show directly that the image of (6.2.3) in End|(V 
k) is
Endg(V 
k) is somewhat complex. Equivalently, we might wonder for which Frobenius
superalgebras, A, is  : OB(A) ! smod-g from Theorem 5.3.4 full? The functor   is
said to be full if for any objects X 2 f"; #g
k1 ; Y 2 f"; #g
k2 , the map
HomOB(A)(X; Y ) ! Homsmod-g( (X);  (Y )) (6.2.4)
is surective.
A particular case of (6.2.4) is showing the superalgebra homomorphism
EndOB(A)("
k) ! Endsmod-g(V 
k
+ );
is surective. Recalling that A
k o Sk ,! EndOB(A)("
k) by (6.2.2), we can more
clearly see the resemblance of (6.2.4) to classical Schur-Weyl duality.

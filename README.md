# Thesis Word Cloud
Word cloud based on my MSc thesis, Affine Oriented Frobenius Brauer Categories and general linear Lie superalgebras. This was created with the [WordCloud package](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/index.html) and examples.

This project was inspired by a [colleague's thesis wordcloud](https://github.com/alburycatalina/ThesisWordCloud).

# My Thesis Word Cloud!

N.B. There are a few easily recognizable math symbols written in plain text here (such as glm, HomC, etc). Less recognizable ones (such as ffX, uvv) which appear commonly in proofs throughout my thesis but don't necessarily carry a fixed meaning are removed.
